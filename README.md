# Using the Kit
Before embarking upon the experiments, there are a few items to cover first. If you have completed one of our other Inventor's Kits before, you should already be familiar with most of the concepts in this section. If this is your first Inventor's Kit, please read carefully to ensure the best possible SIK experience. 

#### Photon RedBoard 

The [SparkFun Photon RedBoard](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13321) is an over-the-air-programmable WiFi development board that is compatible with the [Particle](https://particle.io) cloud, and it is the heart of the SIK for Photon. To learn more about the Photon RedBoard and all it's functionality, visit the [Photon Redboard Hookup Guide](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/photon-redboard-hookup-guide). 

#### Base Plate 

To make circuit development easier, we have included a baseplate onto which you can attach your breadboard and your Photon RedBoard. 

To attach the breadboard, peel off the adhesive backing, and place the breadboard on the baseplate, making sure that the SparkFun logo and text on your breadboard all face the same direction. 

To attach the Photon RedBoard, use the included screws and screwdriver to attach the board tot he baseplate. Again, be sure that the text on the pins matches the directions of the breadboard text and the SparkFun logo. The USB connector should be pointing up when looking directly at the baseplate.

#### Breadboard

Solderless breadboards are the go to prototyping tool for those getting started with electronics. If you have never used a breadboard before, we recommend reading through our [How to Use a Breadboard tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard) before starting with the experiments. 

#### Jumper Wires

This kit includes twenty 6" long jumper wires terminated as male to male. Multiple jumpers can be connected next to one another on a 0.1" header or breadboard.

-> [![jumpers](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/3/2/jumpOff.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/3/3/2/jumpOff.jpg) <-

Each group of jumpers are connected to each other and can either be pulled apart in any quantity or kept whole based on you needs.

# Using the Particle IDE

If you've worked with Arduino or with our SparkFun Inventor's Kit for Arduino, then you are familiar with the Arduino IDE, short for Integrated Development Environment. Particle has created their own cloud-based IDE, and they have adopted the Arduino language and syntax allowing you to move from an Arduino to the Photon and Photon RedBoard with ease. 

Particle has written a great getting started guide for using their Web IDE, called Particle Build. You can read through their documentation by following the link below. 

[Getting Started with Particle Build](https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/build/photon/)

We have also written a Photon Development guide to help aid you in your experience. There are numerous ways to develop with the Photon and Photon RedBoard, and this guide covers the three most common methods: Particle Build, Particle Dev, and ARM GCC. 

For the purposes of this guide, we recommend sticking to the online Particle Build IDE. However, once you feel comfortable using the Photon RedBoard, you are free to explore the other methods for development. 

# Getting Started with the Photon RedBoard

The Photon RedBoard can be powered over either USB (using the included [Micro-B Cable](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13244)) or with a 4.5-15V barrel jack power supply (like either our [5V](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12889) and [9V](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/298) wall warts). To begin using your Photon RedBoard, plug it in!

-> [![USB plugged into Photon RedBoard](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/600-600/assets/learn_tutorials/4/2/1/action-usb-2.jpg)](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/assets/learn_tutorials/4/2/1/action-usb-2.jpg) <-

The red "POWER" LED should illuminate to indicate the Photon RedBoard is on. Once that's verified, it's time to set up WiFi.

### Configuring WiFi, Connecting to Your Particle Account

To use the Particle cloud -- and their online IDE -- you'll need a Particle account. Head over to [build.particle.io](https://build.particle.io/signup) to sign up, if you haven't already.

[Create a Particle Account!](https://build.particle.io/signup)

When you power on a Photon RedBoard for the first time, it should boot up into **listening mode** -- indicated by a blinking, blue LED. It'll remain in listening mode until configured with your WiFi network and password.

There are a handful of ways to configure a Photon's WiFi credentials, including with the **Particle smartphone app** (iOS8+ or Android), or through a **serial terminal**. Unless you're very comfortable with [serial terminals](tutorials/112) -- or just don't have a smartphone nearby -- we recommend using the app.

<div class="alert alert-warning"><b>Windows users:</b> To use the Photon in serial port mode, Windows users will need to install a driver. <a href="https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/connect/core/#installing-the-particle-driver">Follow Particle's "Installing the Particle Driver" guide</a> for help installing the driver.</div>
